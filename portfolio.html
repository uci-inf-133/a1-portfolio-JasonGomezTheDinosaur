<h1>My Portfolio</h1>
<p>By Kiefer Kokhavi</p>

<p>
    Hello dear viewer! Welcome to my portfolio! There is not much here 
    so far, but I will update it as I progress in my programming prowess. :)

<h3>Screenshot from a Game I'm Developing</h3>

<img src="Screenshot 2026-01-12 172407.png" alt="Screenshot of an in-progress
 2D platformer game using placeholder art. A simple player character stands 
 idle on a horizontal platform. Several circular collectible icons are lined 
 up to the left. A developer state chart debug overlay is visible on screen 
 showing “Player 1 → Movement → Grounded,” indicating the character’s current
 state.">

<p>
    It is clearly in a primitive state, but I hope after finalizing level 
    design to implement proper graphics in place of all the placeholders 
    visible here.
